== Ideas for the app, which i will probably add eventually ==
- Find a better solution for fetching data dependent on another fetch, stop using setTimeout...
- Seriously, i need to add an autoFill function when typing items.
- Add commonly searched items.
- Add item catalogue?
- Add a value box where you can put in the amount you are buying.
- Add other helpful functionality.
- Add user functionality, so you can add favorites or something when it can do more than just check prices.
- Add some page for mining or other kind of in-game events?
- Add industry planning functionality?
- Return total volume m3.
- Make an Android application.
- Make it prettier.
- Other stuff eventually?

This application uses the fuzzwork and evemarketer API's.
